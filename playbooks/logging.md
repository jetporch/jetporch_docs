# ðŸ“’ Logging

Starting with the Tech Preview 2 release, jetp emits structured JSON logs to /var/log/jetp/jetp.log or, alterately, a path specified by the environment variable JET\_LOG.  These logs are intended for consumption by software, not humans, with one JSON entry per line.  Different event times will have different levels of detail.

If the path is not writeable, jet will proceed without error.

Log rotation with logrotate is strongly recommended as these logs can be particularly large especially when configuring a large number of hosts, processing complex configurations, or running very many builds that all rely on jetp.

From here, logfiles can be sent to various log aggregrators such as Splunk, Elastic Search, and so on.

The logs are largely self explanatory and include information on playbook paths and task results, as well as summaries of playbook statuses similar to what is produced by the Jet command line.

### JSON Event Types

### JSON Log Event Fields



Not all event types will have all fields in the JSON entries.  Consulting the log examples from a live run is recommended for understanding values.



| Json Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
