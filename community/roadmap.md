# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

[Trello hosts our our public roadmap and planning board](https://trello.com/b/57AyE7ka/jetporch-public-roadmap), which is always evolving. &#x20;

No login is required to view the roadmap.

We want to make running jet from the development branch an always pleasant and _stable_ experience. Further, all official releases are aimed to avoid breaking users with existing content.

While our roadmap is public, it may not contain all that we have coming in any future release.  As releases evolve, we will add notes so users can see what is coming and what to look forward to. Things can shift around at any time!

If you don't want to keep up with trello, the [Substack](blog-and-announcements.md) will always summarize upcoming release features in the announcements category even if you are not signed up for develoment blog topics. If you have a question about upcoming features or plans, stop by the [Discord](discord-chat.md) at any time!
