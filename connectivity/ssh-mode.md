# â–¶ SSH

Jet can connect to remote nodes to manage them using parallel SSH connections.

First, see our [CLI documentation](../basics/command-line-usage.md) for more information about launching playbooks, particularly notes about _--batch-size_ (once available) and _--threads_.

Additional details about SSH connections continues below:

### Variable Control

In SSH mode, a playbook will attempt to all connect to all hosts not named "localhost" using SSH, while a node named "localhost" is treated as special, and still uses the [Local](local-mode.md) connection.

The following inventory variables affect connection behavior:



| Inventory Variable                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| jet\_ssh\_private\_key\_passphrase | while not wildly secure compared to ssh-agent methods, this allows entering a ssh key unlock passphrase as an inventory variable when specifying jet\_ssh\_private\_key\_file (added in v0.2) | the environment variable **JET\_SSH\_PRIVATE\_KEY\_PASSPHRASE** - this requires all keys use the same default unlock password, see [Secret Management](../playbooks/managing-secrets.md) section for tips about how to access this from other tools |



The parameter jet\_ssh\_key\_comment is for use with **ssh-agent only** for when multiple SSH keys are added to SSH agent and multiple different SSH keys are required to connect to all of the systems being managed.

```
ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add some_other_key
ssh-add some_other_key2
jetp ssh --inventory ~/private_inventory --playbook playbook1.yml -vvv
```

The parameters jet\_ssh\_private\_key\_file and jet\_ssh\_private\_key\_passphrase work similarly but **bypass ssh\_agent**.  In general, we suggest using SSH agent, though there may be some reasons to avoid it, such as not having ssh-agent plugins for a particular CI/CD system.

It is technically possible (though confusing?) to have some hosts that use SSH agent and others that do not.
