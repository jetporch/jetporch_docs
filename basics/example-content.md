Rather than understanding Jet's documentation all at once, it's often easier to absorb the concept of Jet's playbook automation by looking at examples and documentation in parallel.&#x20;

```
$ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mpdehaan/jetporch
$ cd jetporch/examples/
```

Jet is designed to at least _approach_ being executable infrastructure policy documentation. When someone looks at Jet playbooks, regardless of familiarity with Jet, they should be able to tell at least roughly what they will do.

Some of our git examples showcase and encourage experimentation with specific language features, while others model more broad and complete real-world scenarios.

These examples are intended to be executed against real local and/or remote infrastructure and experimented with, or used as a starting point for your own content.

To see how to execute the examples, see [Command Line Usage.](command-line-usage.md)
